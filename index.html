  <p>
    SESA is the Software Engineering Students Association for students and alumni of the Software Engineering programme at the <a href="https://auckland.ac.nz">University of Auckland</a>. We organise and run events for members such as LAN parties, shadow classes, and careers evenings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Where necessary we also act as a liaison between the department and the SE students, raising any relevant issues (course content, difficulties in learning).
